# Local PDF RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline
An implementation of a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that demonstrates how retrieval and generation can be combined for effective information extraction. This project is ideal for anyone interested in learning or applying RAG in natural language processing (NLP) applications.

📋 Project Overview
Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a powerful approach that combines a retriever model, which finds relevant information from a document set, and a generator model, which uses this information to produce a contextual response. This method is widely used in conversational AI, question-answering systems, and other applications requiring efficient knowledge extraction and natural language generation.

This project implements a straightforward RAG pipeline to:

Retrieve relevant passages from a document set.
Generate responses based on the retrieved content.

🚀 Key Features
Document Retrieval: Retrieves relevant documents based on user input using [specific retriever model].
Answer Generation: Generates coherent, contextually appropriate responses using [specific generator model].
Seamless Integration: Full code for setting up and running the RAG pipeline locally.
Extensibility: Easily configurable to use different datasets and models.

📊 Results and Performance
Retrieval Accuracy: Successfully retrieves contextually relevant information from large datasets.
Response Quality: Generates responses that accurately summarize or elaborate on retrieved content.
Efficiency: Demonstrates optimal performance for small to mid-sized datasets with adjustable retrieval and generation settings.

⚙️ Configuration
Retriever Model: Specify your choice of retriever model in config.py.
Generator Model: Set the generator model details (e.g., Hugging Face model name) in config.py.
Dataset: Load your dataset in the data folder and update paths in config.py if necessary.

🧩 Extending the Project
This project is designed to be modular, allowing you to:

Swap out the retriever and generator models with other compatible models.
Integrate additional preprocessing steps for specialized datasets.
Adjust hyperparameters to optimize retrieval and generation performance
