# Local-PDF-RAG-Pipeline
An implementation of a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to demonstrate the process of combining retrieval techniques with generation models for effective information extraction.

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project showcases a basic RAG pipeline, which leverages a retriever model to find relevant documents and a generator model to provide comprehensive, contextual answers based on these documents. This technique is essential for applications needing efficient information retrieval with precise response generation.

ðŸš€ Features
Efficient Document Retrieval: Uses [specific retriever model] to find relevant text passages.
Contextual Answer Generation: Employs [specific generator model] to generate responses based on retrieved documents.
End-to-End Pipeline: Complete code for setting up and running the RAG model locally.

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Provides accurate information retrieval with generative responses.
Demonstrates efficient handling of diverse questions and extensive document data.
